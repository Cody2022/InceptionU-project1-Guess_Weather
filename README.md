# InceptioinU full stack developer program-Project1-Guess_Weather

*Project Objectives:

- To develop APIs, pass info to APIs, execute logic, and return response
- To call third-party APIs and integrate the responses of third-party APIs to the game
- To connect MongoDB and perform CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete documents)
- To develop a playable game of guessing temperatures of different cities

*Technologies:
JavaScript, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, GitHub 


*Game steps:
1. To enter the game  (Call a geolocation API and OpenWeather API, connect MongoDB and create a collection)
2. To check the cities in the game box
3. To add city to the game box
4. To delete city from the game box
5. To set the accuracy and start guessing
6. To review the game results
(Steps 2-6: Call the OpenWeather API, perform CRUD operations, and conduct comparison)
7. To save game results (Create a new collection, define a combination of fields to be unique, and save data to the MongoDB)


*Key learnings:
- Use ExpressJS to develop server and create multiple API endpoints
- Call async third-party APIs and handle errors
- Perform CRUD operations on MongoDB
- Use GitHub to pull and push files and resolve emerge conflicts
- Use console.log() to debug
